__Play with synthetic data__

Run R code Synthetic_data.r to simulate, visualise and do preliminary exploration of ATN data.
Fit a smoothed curve/ plane through points. 
What does this tell you about the relationships between the biomakers?
What metrics can you use to interpret these associations?
What aesthetics are important when visualising 3D data? implement them.
What features/ associations can you describe in 3D that are limited in 2D?

If possible, generate a short video/ snippet highlighting important features of this data.

__Tasks to do:__
-Improve on visualisations, insert planes to mark biomarker cut-offs.

- Propose methodolgy to fit curve/ plane to data.

- Reference methodology in literature.

- Think about longitudinal data for biomarkers.
