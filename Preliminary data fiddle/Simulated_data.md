MC TODO: 
Insert R code to simulate cross-sectional syntyhetic amyloid, tau and hippocampus volume, in addition to basic participant features such as age and clinical classification
Visualise data in 2D and 3D space.

- Good tutorial with code to incrementally start plotting and visualising data in 3D, finishes off with fitting plane over data points and creation of a movie/ html file.

__Tasks to do:__
-Improve on visualisations, insert planes to mark biomarker cut-offs.

- Propose methodolgy to fit curve/ plane to data.

- Reference methodology in literature.

- Think about longitudinal data for biomarkers.
