# Additional resources

Due to the short vacation period of 3 months, to help explain the features of interest, mainly amyloid plaques, tau tangles and neurodegeneration measured by hippocampal volume, below are some links to educational and short videos.


## Quick video introduction to explain how amyloid and tau affect the brain during AD

Amyloid plaques and tau tangles explained by Biogen [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBvWadjjwXs).

## Neurodegeneration

Measured by Magnetic Resonance Imaging, the hippocampus volume (sum of the left and right hippocampi volumes) measured by mm^3 is one of the first regions of the brain to be affected by the AD pathway.

Free online website to visualise 3D animations of parts of the brain [link](http://lifesciencedb.jp/bp3d/). One can generate gifs for different selected body part animations. See hippocampus gif from [wikipedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hippocampus.gif) website.



## Data source for the project: AIBL study

## Statistical resources and notes

Good paper to peruse: it would be interesting to use these methods for the ATN, in a 3 x 3 plot to investigate for associations. It would also be of interest to see if if this was available for higher dimensional case, i.e. view two variables against a third in a null hypothesis setting (H0 is true), versus when H0 is not true.

Good R package to consider: tourr, repository and example available [here](https://github.com/ggobi/tourr).
TODO: look up other examples and publicly available data to familiarise tourr package.
