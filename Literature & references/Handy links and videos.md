# Additional resources

Due to the short vacation period of 3 months, to help explain the features of interest, mainly amyloid plaques, tau tangles and neurodegeneration measured by hippocampal volume, below are some links to educational and short videos.


## Quick video introduction to explain how amyloid and tau affect the brain during AD

Amyloid plaques and tau tangles explained by Biogen [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBvWadjjwXs).

## Neurodegeneration

Measured by Magnetic Resonance Imaging, the hippocampus volume (sum of the left and right hippocampi volumes) measured by mm^3 is one of the first regions of the brain to be affected by the AD pathway.
