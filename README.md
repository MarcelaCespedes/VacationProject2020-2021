# Vacation Project 2020-2021

This repository will be a hub for generic resources during Nov 2020 - Feb 2021 project vacation period. 

__Project titled:__ Multidimensional amyloid, tau and neurodegeneration models

__Summary:__ The three biomarkers, amyloid, tau and neurodegeneration, proposed by Clifford et. al. 2016 has been successfully used to describe the different stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However this descriptive approach considers the binary form of these biomarkers and does not provide information onthe joint modelling over the range in biomarker values. This project aims to develop multidimensional statistical and mathematical models based on these three biomarkers to identify trends and capture the AD staging process alond the continuous domain of all three biomarkers.
