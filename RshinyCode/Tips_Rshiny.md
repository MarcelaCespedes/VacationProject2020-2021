# General RShiny links and tips

* The first (and main) link to get started on is the official Shiny link from RStudio found [here](https://shiny.rstudio.com/).

* A good general introduction tutorial is found [here](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/); note this goes for over 2 hours.
  + Lucy, I will take you through the example R code to provide a hands on introduction on how to run the RShiny app. This video is very useful if you need to get started on your own from scratch.

* After you're familiar with the two script files (`ui.R` and `server.R`, or the more succint way to run an app with `app.R`) and can run your app locally in your machine - you're ready to start sharing the app. I recommend you create an account to host your app with https://www.shinyapps.io/.
  + A tutorial which explains how this works is found [here](https://vimeo.com/rstudioinc/review/131218530/212d8a5a7a/#t=30m35s).
  + I can show you how I've created my app for a different project, how to update it once you make changes to your local version of the app and how we will manage this at work.
  
__NOTE:__ The tips above are for a generic app. Since you'll be working on AIBL data, we will mount the app using the servers at work and share the app internally (I will show you how to do this). The app with AIBL data will not be mounted on the RStudio servers.
