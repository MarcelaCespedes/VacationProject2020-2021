# General RShiny links and tips

* The first (and main) link to get started on is the official Shiny link from RStudio found [here](https://shiny.rstudio.com/).

* A good general introduction tutorial is found [here](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/); note this goes for over 2 hours.
  + Lucy, I will take you through the example R code to provide a hands on introduction on how to run the RShiny app. This video is very useful if you need to get started on your own from scratch.

* After you're familiar with the two script files (`ui.R` and `server.R`, or the more succint way to run an app with `app.R`) and can run your app locally in your machine - you're ready to start sharing the app. I recommend you create an account to host your app with https://www.shinyapps.io/.
  + A tutorial which explains how this works is found [here](https://vimeo.com/rstudioinc/review/131218530/212d8a5a7a/#t=30m35s).
